# Customer-churn-prediction

## 📌 Project Overview
Customer churn is a significant challenge for businesses, especially in the telecom sector. This project leverages **machine learning** to predict whether a customer is likely to churn, allowing companies to take proactive measures to retain them.

## 🔍 Dataset
The dataset used in this project comes from a telecom company and includes features such as **tenure, monthly charges, total charges, contract type, payment method, and customer demographics**.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- **Machine Learning** (Scikit-Learn, XGBoost, Random Forest, Decision Tree)
- **Data Preprocessing** (Feature Engineering, Handling Missing Values, Label Encoding, Standardization)
- **Imbalanced Data Handling** (SMOTE)

## 🚀 Steps Involved
1. **Data Exploration & Cleaning**
2. **Feature Engineering**
3. **Model Training & Selection**
4. **Evaluation using Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, and Classification Report**
5. **Model Deployment (Optional)**

## 📊 Results & Insights
The models were evaluated based on accuracy and other performance metrics. The insights derived can help businesses **identify at-risk customers** and take action to reduce churn.

## 🎯 Future Improvements
- Deploy the model using **Flask/FastAPI**
- Enhance feature selection using advanced techniques
- Experiment with deep learning approaches
